4/8/21 Automatically deletes newly created file after code execution window is closed.

4/8/21 Specification of new file name and extension is no longer needed (just don't have a file on your desktop called "11111111111111111111111111111111").

4/8/21 Added "-NoNewWindow" so that you don't need an input statement at the end of code to keep it open.
